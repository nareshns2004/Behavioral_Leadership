#Technical Interview
#DSA System_Design - Learnable Skills - Practice

--> Jumping to solution very early without asking clarifying questions (shows immaturity)
Questions? a vague, ambigous question,story like, need to extract dsa question from it

--> Not fine coding, syntax error, semicolon missing (hands on coding every day coding)

--> While solving speak out loud, to explain thought process to interviewer (was it rote memorized or made up solution)
if you have seen question, tell them you have seen the question

--> Interviewer taking notes of characterstics, like coding speed, follow up questions (sees approach), give hints can you catch them
can you dry run the solution, can you debug your code, Time & Space complexity errors

--> Speed is an eliminating factor (interviewer prepared 2 questions, but in time it was able to ask 1)
